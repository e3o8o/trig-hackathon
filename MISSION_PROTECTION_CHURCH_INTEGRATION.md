## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Form Data Structure (Updated)
```typescript
interface ProtectionFormData {
  destination: string
  country: string
  startDate: string
  endDate: string
  coverageAmount: string
  tripPurpose: string
  organizationType: 'registered' | 'custom'  // NEW
  churchId: string                           // NEW

}
```

### New State Fields
- `organizationType`: Tracks which option user selected

### Validation Logic (Updated)
```typescript

```

Now requires either:
- Church ID (registered option) OR
- Organization name (custom option)

### Church Data Source
```typescript
const VERIFIED_CHURCHES = [
  {
    id: 'CHURCH-001',
    name: 'Grace Community Church',
    location: 'Dallas, TX',
    denomination: 'Non-denominational',
    verified: true
  },
  // ... 7 more churches
