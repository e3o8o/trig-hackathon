## 🚫 Skipped Tasks (11/25)

### LayerZero Cross-Chain Tasks (Intentionally Skipped)

**Rationale**: LayerZero dependencies were removed during Phase 1 due to compilation conflicts and time constraints. Cross-chain functionality is deferred to post-MVP.

- ❌ Task 2.6: Create CrossChainState Contract
- ❌ Task 2.7: Implement Cross-Chain Message Types
- ❌ Task 2.8: Add Cross-Chain Condition Support
- ❌ Task 2.15: Redeploy Core with Final Changes (referenced cross-chain)

### Non-Critical Optimization Tasks (Deferred)

**Rationale**: Current implementation is functional and gas costs are reasonable. Premature optimization can be done post-hackathon.

- ❌ Task 2.4: Optimize Gas Usage
- ❌ Task 2.5: Write Comprehensive Core Tests (we have 49 passing tests)
- ❌ Task 2.10: Gas Optimization Round 2
- ❌ Task 2.11: Security Review - Core (basic security implemented)
- ❌ Task 2.12: Create Core Contract Interfaces
- ❌ Task 2.13: Write Core Documentation (basic docs exist)
- ❌ Task 2.16: Create Condition Factory Utilities

### Gas Optimization Notes

1. **TrigCore** condition creation is efficient (~277k gas)
2. **Steward contracts** have higher gas due to verification checks
3. All functions are **under 400k gas** (safe for mainnet)
4. **View functions** cost zero gas (not shown in table)
5. **viaIR optimizer** enabled to handle "stack too deep" errors
