## ‚õ™ For Organizations

### Step 1: Register Your Organization

**Requirements**:
- 0.1 ETH minimum stake
- Organization name (max 100 characters)
- Description (max 500 characters)
- Website URL (max 100 characters)

**How to Register**:

```javascript
// Using ethers.js
const stake = ethers.parseEther("0.1"); // 0.1 ETH
const tx = await oracleRegistry.registerOrganization(
    "Grace Community Church",
    "A vibrant community church serving our local area",
    "https://gracecommunity.org",
    { value: stake }
);
await tx.wait();
```

**What Happens**:
1. Your 0.1 ETH stake is locked in the contract
2. Organization profile is created
3. Status: **PENDING** (needs 3 verifications)
4. Event emitted: `OrganizationRegistered`

### Step 2: Get Verified

**Verification Requirements**:
- 3 independent verifier approvals
- Verifiers must have 0.5 ETH stake each
- Each verifier can only approve once

**How to Find Verifiers**:
1. Join Steward Discord/Telegram
2. Submit verification request with documentation
3. Wait for community verifiers to review
4. Track verification status on-chain

**After Verification**:
- ‚úÖ Status: **VERIFIED**
- ‚úÖ Can receive tithe commitments
- ‚úÖ Can be included in mission protection policies
- ‚úÖ Visible in verified organizations list

### Step 3: Receive Donations

**Automatic Tithe Payments**:
- Givers create commitments to your organization
- Payments execute automatically (weekly, monthly, etc.)
- ETH sent directly to your organization address
- Track all donations via events

**Viewing Your Donations**:

```javascript
// Get all commitments to your organization
const commitments = await tithe.getOrganizationCommitments(orgAddress);

// Get total received
const totalReceived = await tithe.totalAmountGiven();
```

### Step 4: Manage Your Profile

**Update Leaders** (if supported):
```javascript
await oracleRegistry.addLeader(leaderAddress);
await oracleRegistry.removeLeader(leaderAddress);
```

**Withdraw Stake** (if leaving):
```javascript
await oracleRegistry.withdrawStake(yourAddress);
// Note: May have waiting period
```

## üõ°Ô∏è For Verifiers

### Becoming a Verifier

**Requirements**:
- 0.5 ETH minimum stake
- Good reputation (track record)
- Commitment to verify honestly

**Registration**:

```javascript
const stake = ethers.parseEther("0.5");
const tx = await oracleRegistry.registerVerifier({ value: stake });
await tx.wait();
// You now have VERIFIER_ROLE
```

### Verifying Organizations

**Process**:
1. Review organization's documentation
2. Verify legitimacy (website, social media, etc.)
3. Check for red flags
4. Submit on-chain verification

**Submit Verification**:

```javascript
await oracleRegistry.verifyOrganization(organizationAddress);
// Your verification is recorded
```

**Important**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You can only verify each organization ONCE
- ‚ö†Ô∏è False verifications can result in slashing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Your stake is at risk if you verify malicious orgs

### Earning & Reputation

**Benefits**:
- Help build trusted community
- Earn reputation points
- Contribute to ecosystem security

**Risks**:
- Slashing for bad verifications
- Loss of verifier status if stake falls below minimum

## üíù For Givers

### Creating a Tithe Commitment

**Choose Your Frequency**:
- WEEKLY (0) - Every 7 days
- BIWEEKLY (1) - Every 14 days
- MONTHLY (2) - Every 30 days
- QUARTERLY (3) - Every 90 days
- YEARLY (4) - Every 365 days

**Create Commitment**:

```javascript
const amount = ethers.parseEther("0.01"); // 0.01 ETH per payment
const frequency = 2; // MONTHLY
const endTime = 0; // 0 = indefinite, or timestamp

const tx = await tithe.createCommitment(
    organizationAddress,
    amount,
    ethers.ZeroAddress, // ETH (use token address for ERC20)
    frequency,
    endTime,
    { value: amount } // First payment
);
await tx.wait();
```

**What Happens**:
1. First payment executes immediately
2. Commitment is recorded on-chain
3. Subsequent payments due at regular intervals
4. Anyone can execute due payments (gas incentive)

### Managing Your Commitments

**Pause a Commitment**:
```javascript
await tithe.pauseCommitment(commitmentId);
// Pauses future payments
```

**Resume a Commitment**:
```javascript
await tithe.resumeCommitment(commitmentId);
// Resumes payments
```

**Cancel a Commitment**:
```javascript
await tithe.cancelCommitment(commitmentId);
// Permanently ends commitment
```

**View Your Commitments**:
```javascript
const commitments = await tithe.getGiverCommitments(yourAddress);
```

### Executing Payments

**Anyone Can Execute**:
```javascript
// Check if payment is due
const isDue = await tithe.isPaymentDue(commitmentId);

if (isDue) {
    const commitment = await tithe.getCommitment(commitmentId);
    await tithe.executeTithePayment(
        commitmentId,
        { value: commitment.amount } // Send payment amount
    );
}
```

**Why Allow Anyone?**:
- Enables automation services
- Gas incentive for executors
- You don't have to remember

## ‚úàÔ∏è For Mission Travelers

### Purchasing Mission Protection

**Policy Types**:
- MISSION_TRIP (0) - Short-term mission trips
- LONG_TERM_MISSION (1) - Multi-month assignments
- RELIEF_OPERATION (2) - Disaster relief
- CONFERENCE (3) - Ministry conferences
- OTHER (4) - Other ministry events

**Calculate Premium**:
```javascript
const coverage = ethers.parseEther("1"); // 1 ETH coverage
const premium = await mission.calculatePremium(coverage);
// Premium = coverage * 2% = 0.02 ETH
```

**Purchase Policy**:

```javascript
const currentTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
const startDate = currentTime + 86400; // Tomorrow
const endDate = startDate + (7 * 86400); // 1 week trip

const tx = await mission.purchasePolicy(
    organizationAddress, // Your sending organization
    0, // MISSION_TRIP
    "Summer Mission Trip to Guatemala",
    "Guatemala City, Guatemala",
    startDate,
    endDate,
    coverage,
    ethers.ZeroAddress, // ETH
    { value: premium }
);
await tx.wait();
```

### Filing a Claim

**When to File**:
- Trip cancelled due to covered reason
- Emergency evacuation needed
- Medical emergency during trip
- Other covered events

**Submit Claim**:

```javascript
const claimAmount = ethers.parseEther("0.5"); // Partial claim

const tx = await mission.submitClaim(
    policyId,
    claimAmount,
    "Trip cancelled due to civil unrest. Embassy advisory issued."
);
await tx.wait();
```

**What Happens Next**:
1. Claim is recorded on-chain
2. Owner reviews claim evidence
3. Owner approves or rejects
4. If approved, funds sent automatically

### Cancelling a Policy

**Before Trip Starts**:
```javascript
await mission.cancelPolicy(policyId);
// 90% refund (10% cancellation fee)
```

**After Trip Starts**:
- No refund available
- Can still file claims during coverage period

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

**"Organization not verified"**
- Your organization needs 3 verifier approvals
- Contact verifiers in the community
- Provide documentation for verification

**"Payment not due yet"**
- Wait until payment interval has passed
- Check `isPaymentDue(commitmentId)`
- Last payment time + frequency must have passed

**"Insufficient contract balance"**
- MissionProtection contract needs funds to pay claims
- DeFi backing integration coming soon
- Contact admin to add liquidity

**"Commitment not active"**
- Check if commitment is paused
- Check if commitment has ended
- Use `getCommitment()` to see status

**"Already verified by you"**
- Each verifier can only verify an organization once
- Cannot verify same org multiple times

### Gas Optimization Tips

**Batch Operations**:
- Create multiple commitments in one session
- Execute multiple due payments together
- Group administrative actions

**Timing**:
- Execute during low network congestion
- Use gas price estimators
- Set reasonable gas limits

### Transaction Failed?

**Check**:
1. Sufficient ETH for gas + payment
2. Correct contract address
3. Valid parameters (amounts, addresses)
4. Network status (Base Sepolia operational)
5. Wallet connection

**Retry**:
- Increase gas limit slightly
- Wait for network congestion to clear
- Check transaction on block explorer
