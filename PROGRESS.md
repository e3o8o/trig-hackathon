## 🚧 **Blockers & Issues**

### **Issue #1: Hardhat Compilation Dependency Conflict**
**Severity**: Medium
**Description**: Hardhat toolbox has peer dependency conflicts between ethers v5 and v6
**Impact**: Cannot compile contracts yet
**Next Steps**:
1. Try fresh install with specific versions
2. Consider using Foundry instead of Hardhat
3. Manually resolve peer dependency tree

**Workaround**: Contract code is written and ready, just needs compilation environment fixed

## 🚨 **Risk Assessment**

### **Low Risk** 🟢
- ✅ Project structure is solid
- ✅ Git workflow is working
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive
- ✅ Core contract logic is implemented

### **Medium Risk** 🟡
- ⚠️ Hardhat compilation issues (workaround available)
- ⚠️ Time management for 72-hour sprint
- ⚠️ Testing needs to catch up with development

### **Mitigations**
- Consider Foundry as alternative to Hardhat
- Allocate 50% time to testing (as planned)
- Have fallback options for blocked tasks

---

## 📞 **Team Communication**

### **For Team Members**
- ✅ All documentation is ready for review
- ✅ GitHub repository is accessible
- ✅ Core contract is implemented
- ⚠️ Compilation fix needed before proceeding

### **Next Team Sync**
**Topics to Discuss**:
1. Review TrigImmutableCore implementation
2. Discuss compilation fix approach
3. Assign test writing tasks
4. Plan Christian contract development

---

## 📝 **Notes**

### **Technical Decisions Made**
1. **CommonJS over ESM**: Reverted to CommonJS due to Hardhat compatibility
2. **JavaScript config**: Using .js instead of .ts for Hardhat config
3. **Legacy peer deps**: Using --legacy-peer-deps flag for LayerZero packages
4. **OpenZeppelin patterns**: Used MCP tool for secure contract scaffolding

### **Lessons Learned**
1. LayerZero packages have peer dependency conflicts with ethers v6
2. Hardhat toolbox installation can be problematic
3. Having comprehensive documentation upfront helps development flow
4. Git commits should be frequent with meaningful messages
