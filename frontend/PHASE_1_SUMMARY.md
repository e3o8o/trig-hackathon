## 💻 Technical Architecture

### State Management
```typescript
commitments[]           // All user commitments
pendingExecutions[]     // Payments waiting confirmation
selectedCommitment      // Current execution target
isExecuting            // Transaction in progress
showExecutionModal     // Modal visibility
executionSuccess       // Success state flag
isLoading              // Initial data loading
```

### Key Functions
1. **calculateCommitmentTotals()** - Computes amounts based on percentages
2. **handleManualExecution()** - Opens execution modal
3. **executePayment()** - Simulates blockchain transaction
4. **toggleCommitmentStatus()** - Pauses/resumes commitment
5. **formatCurrency()** - Formats dollar amounts
6. **formatDate()** - Formats dates consistently

## 🚀 Integration Roadmap

### Phase 2: Connect to Smart Contracts

#### Step 1: Deploy Contracts
```solidity
TitheManager.sol
├─ createCommitment()
├─ executePayment()
├─ pauseCommitment()
├─ resumeCommitment()
└─ getUserCommitments()
```

#### Step 2: Update Frontend
```typescript
// Replace simulated data
const commitments = await readContract({
  address: TITHE_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
  abi: TITHE_MANAGER_ABI,
  functionName: 'getUserCommitments',
  args: [address]
})
```

#### Step 3: Integrate Trig Protocol
```typescript
// Set up Trig condition
await trigProtocol.createCondition({
  type: 'INCOME_RECEIVED',
  threshold: commitment.incomeThreshold,
  action: 'EXECUTE_TITHE',
  commitmentId: commitment.id
})
```

#### Step 4: Real Transactions
```typescript
// Execute real payment
const { hash } = await writeContract({
  address: TITHE_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
  abi: TITHE_MANAGER_ABI,
  functionName: 'executeTithePayment',
  args: [commitmentId]
})
```

**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours
