## 🔗 Integration Points

### Links to Other Pages
- **Home** (`/`): Back navigation
- **Create Tithe** (`/create-tithe`): Create new commitment
- **Giving History** (`/giving-history`): View full payment history (coming in Phase 2)

### Wallet Integration

## 🚀 Smart Contract Integration (Future)

When smart contracts are deployed, update these functions:

### Load Commitments
```typescript
// Replace simulated data loading with:
const commitments = await readContract({
  address: TITHE_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
  abi: TITHE_MANAGER_ABI,
  functionName: 'getUserCommitments',
  args: [address]
})
```

### Execute Payment
```typescript
// Replace setTimeout simulation with:
const { hash } = await writeContract({
  address: TITHE_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
  abi: TITHE_MANAGER_ABI,
  functionName: 'executeTithePayment',
  args: [commitmentId]
})

await waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash })
```

### Toggle Status
```typescript
const { hash } = await writeContract({
  address: TITHE_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
  abi: TITHE_MANAGER_ABI,
  functionName: isPaused ? 'resumeCommitment' : 'pauseCommitment',
  args: [commitmentId]
})
```
