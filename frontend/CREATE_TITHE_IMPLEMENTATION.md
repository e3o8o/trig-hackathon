- No actual blockchain calls (code commented for future implementation)

### Simulated Churches
1. Grace Community Church (Dallas, TX) - Non-denominational
2. First Baptist Church (Austin, TX) - Baptist
3. New Hope Fellowship (Houston, TX) - Pentecostal
4. Covenant Presbyterian Church (San Antonio, TX) - Presbyterian

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
- React `useState` for state management
- `useAccount` from wagmi for wallet connection
- Next.js `Link` for navigation
- Custom icon components
- WalletConnectButton component

### State Management
- Current step tracking
- Form data (church, income, percentages, frequency)
- Commitment ID
- Search term
- Processing state

### Calculations
- Monthly tithe = income × tithe%
- Monthly offering = income × offering%
- Total monthly = tithe + offering
- Annual total = monthly × 12

## 🚀 Ready for Smart Contract Integration

The code includes commented blockchain integration:

```typescript
// Uncomment when smart contract is ready:
/*
const { hash } = await writeContract({
  address: '0x...', // Tithe Manager contract address
  abi: [...],
  functionName: 'createTitheCommitment',
  args: [
    formData.churchId,
    parseEther(formData.incomeThreshold),
    BigInt(formData.tithePercentage * 100),
    BigInt(formData.offeringPercentage * 100),
    formData.frequency
  ],
})
*/
```
