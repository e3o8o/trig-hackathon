# Copilot Instructions for Steward Next.js Project

## Project Overview
- This is a Next.js (TypeScript) frontend for the Steward platform.
- Uses the App Router (`app/` directory) and is set up for wallet integration (wagmi, viem).

## Key Structure
- `app/` â€“ Next.js app directory (routing, layouts, pages)
- `components/` â€“ Shared React components
- `styles/` â€“ CSS modules and global styles
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` â€“ AI agent guidance (this file)

## Developer Workflows
- **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
- **Run dev server:** `npm run dev`
- **Build for production:** `npm run build`
- **Wallet integration:** Use `wagmi` and `viem` for EVM wallet connections
- **Add new pages:** Place in `app/` as folders with `page.tsx`
- **Add shared UI:** Place in `components/`

## Project Conventions
- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer functional React components
- Use the App Router (`app/` directory) for all routing
- Use only Tailwind classes and write minimum custom CSS
- Use CSS modules or global styles in `styles/`
- Place reusable UI in `components/`
- Use `wagmi` hooks for wallet state/connection

## Integration Points
- Wallet connection logic should be placed in `components/` or a dedicated `hooks/` directory
- For blockchain interactions, use `viem` and `wagmi` together

## Examples
- To add a new page: `app/example/page.tsx`
- To add a wallet connect button: `components/WalletConnectButton.tsx`

## Additional Notes
- No backend code in this repo
- Keep README.md up to date with new workflows
- For more, see Next.js and wagmi documentation

# ðŸš€ Trig Protocol + Steward: Team Briefing & User Stories

**Project**: Christian Financial Stewardship Platform on Blockchain
**Duration**: 72-hour Hackathon
**Team Size**: 3 members (2 developers + 1 non-technical)
**Target**: Working demo with real-world use cases


---


## ðŸŽ¯ **What Are We Building? (30-Second Pitch)**


We're building **Steward** - a blockchain platform that helps Christians practice faithful financial stewardship through automated giving, mission trip protection, and transparent church accountability. It's powered by **Trig Protocol**, which enables smart contracts that automatically execute when real-world conditions are met.


**Think of it as**: "If This, Then That" (IFTTT) for Christian giving and insurance, backed by real money from DeFi protocols.


## ðŸ“– **Core User Stories**


### **Epic 1: Automated Tithing System**


#### **User Story 1.1: Create Tithe Commitment**
```
AS A Christian believer
I WANT TO set up automatic tithing to my church
SO THAT I can practice consistent biblical giving without manual effort
```


**Acceptance Criteria**:
- âœ… User can connect their wallet
- âœ… User can select a verified church from a list
- âœ… User can set income threshold (e.g., "$5,000/month")
- âœ… User can set tithe percentage (e.g., "10%")
- âœ… User can add additional offering percentage (e.g., "5% to missions")
- âœ… User can preview the commitment before confirming
- âœ… Transaction is recorded on blockchain
- âœ… User receives confirmation


**User Journey**:
```mermaid
graph LR
   A[Connect Wallet] --> B[Browse Churches]
   B --> C[Select Church]
   C --> D[Set Income Threshold]
   D --> E[Set Percentages]
   E --> F[Preview Commitment]
   F --> G[Sign Transaction]
   G --> H[Confirmation]
```


**Example Scenario**:
> Sarah is a software engineer earning $8,000/month. She wants to tithe 10% to her local church and give an additional 5% to missions. She sets up her commitment once, and every month when her income comes in, the system automatically transfers $800 to her church and $400 to missions.


#### **User Story 1.2: Execute Tithe Payment**
```
AS A believer with a tithe commitment
I WANT my tithe to execute automatically when I receive income
SO THAT I don't forget to give and practice faithful stewardship
```


**Acceptance Criteria**:
- âœ… System monitors when user receives income
- âœ… Calculates correct tithe amount based on percentage
- âœ… Splits payment between church and missions if specified
- âœ… Executes transfer automatically
- âœ… Records transaction in giving history
- âœ… Sends notification to user and church
- âœ… Generates giving receipt


**User Journey**:
```mermaid
graph TD
   A[Income Received] --> B[System Detects Income]
   B --> C[Calculate Tithe Amount]
   C --> D[Verify Church Address]
   D --> E[Execute Transfer]
   E --> F[Update Giving History]
   F --> G[Send Notifications]
   G --> H[Generate Receipt]
```


**Example Scenario**:
> Sarah receives her monthly salary on the 1st of each month. The system automatically detects this, calculates her 10% tithe ($800) and 5% offering ($400), and transfers the funds to her church and missions fund. She receives a notification with her giving receipt for tax purposes.


#### **User Story 1.3: View Giving History**
```
AS A believer who tithes
I WANT TO see my complete giving history
SO THAT I can track my stewardship and have records for tax purposes
```


**Acceptance Criteria**:
- âœ… User can view all past tithe payments
- âœ… See amounts, dates, and recipients
- âœ… View running totals (yearly, lifetime)
- âœ… Export giving statements
- âœ… See blockchain proof of each payment


**Example Scenario**:
> At tax time, Sarah needs her annual giving statement. She logs into Steward, views her complete history, and exports a report showing she gave $9,600 to church and $4,800 to missions in 2024.
