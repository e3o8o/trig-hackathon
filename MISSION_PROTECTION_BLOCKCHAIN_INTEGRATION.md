# Mission Protection Blockchain Integration

## Overview
Implemented full blockchain integration for the Mission Protection feature with demo-friendly pricing ($1 premium for testing).

## Changes Made

### 1. Currency Conversion (ETH ↔ USD)
- **Added ETH_TO_USD constant**: 4608.59 (same rate as other pages)
- **USD Display**: All UI shows USD values for user-friendly experience
- **ETH Transactions**: Converts to ETH behind the scenes for blockchain

### 2. Demo-Friendly Coverage Options
Restored original coverage amounts with **fixed $1 premium for all options** (makes testing affordable):

| Coverage | Premium (Demo) | ETH Cost |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| $1,000   | $1.00          | ~0.000217 ETH |
| $2,000   | $1.00          | ~0.000217 ETH |
| $3,000   | $1.00          | ~0.000217 ETH |
| $5,000   | $1.00          | ~0.000217 ETH |
| $10,000  | $1.00          | ~0.000217 ETH |

**Note**: In production, premium would be 2% of coverage (e.g., $1,000 coverage = $20 premium). For demo purposes, all premiums are fixed at $1 to make testing affordable.

### 3. Premium Calculation
- **Demo Rate**: Fixed $1.00 premium for all coverage levels (makes testing affordable)
- **Production Rate**: Would be 2% (200 basis points) - matches MissionProtection.sol contract
- **Formula (Demo)**: `premiumUSD = 1.00` (fixed for all coverage amounts)
- **Formula (Production)**: `premiumUSD = coverageUSD * 0.02`
- **Blockchain Note**: Contract expects 2% premium, but for demo we're using a fixed low amount
- **Conversion**: Automatically converts USD amounts to ETH for transactions

### 4. Transaction Flow
1. **User selects coverage** in USD (e.g., $10,000)
2. **Premium calculated** as fixed $1.00 (demo pricing)
3. **Conversion to ETH** happens automatically:
   - Coverage: $10,000 → ~2.17 ETH
   - Premium: $1.00 → ~0.000217 ETH
4. **Transaction sent** to blockchain with ETH values
5. **Contract stores** policy with full $10,000 coverage (in ETH equivalent)

**Important**: The contract's `calculatePremium()` function expects 2% premium, but for demo purposes we're paying a fixed $1. In production, you would need to either:
- Update contract's premium rate
- Or pay the full 2% premium ($200 for $10,000 coverage)

### 5. Smart Contract Integration

#### Contract Function Called:
```solidity
function purchasePolicy(
    address organization,      // Verified church address
    EventType eventType,       // 0 = MISSION_TRIP
    string calldata eventName, // "{purpose} to {destination}"
    string calldata location,  // "{destination}, {country}"
    uint256 startDate,         // Unix timestamp
    uint256 endDate,           // Unix timestamp
    uint256 coverageAmount,    // Coverage in ETH (converted from USD)
    address coverageToken      // 0x0 for ETH
) external payable
```

#### Parameters Sent:
- `organization`: Selected church address from registry
- `eventType`: 0 (MISSION_TRIP enum value)
- `eventName`: e.g., "Medical Mission to Medical Mission"
- `location`: e.g., "Kenya, East Africa, Kenya"
- `startDate`: Trip start as Unix timestamp
- `endDate`: Trip end as Unix timestamp
- `coverageAmount`: Coverage in ETH (e.g., parseEther("0.01085") for $50)
- `coverageToken`: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (ETH)
- `msg.value`: Premium in ETH (e.g., parseEther("0.000217") for $1)

### 6. Church Selection
- Uses verified organizations from `StewardOracleRegistry`
- Falls back to mock churches if no organizations registered
- Requires church to be selected (claim approval needs church leaders)

### 7. UI Updates

#### Coverage Step
- Shows premium calculation for each option
- Displays in USD with approximate ETH value
- Clear labeling: "~$1 premium" for demo option

#### Review Step
- Coverage Summary shows USD amounts
- Added ETH conversion info: "≈ 0.000217 ETH @ $4,608.59 per ETH"
- Button shows USD amount: "Pay $1.00 & Purchase Policy"

#### Success Step
- Transaction hash displayed
- Link to Base Sepolia block explorer
- Shows coverage and premium paid in USD

### 8. Technical Details

#### Contract Addresses (Base Sepolia)
```typescript
mission: {
  address: '0x31C31Bcfa4149132B64b3F00F11EdE1D2e39bE12',
  abi: MissionABI.abi,
}
```

#### Premium Rate Configuration
```typescript
export const MISSION_CONFIG = {
  premiumRate: 2, // 2% premium rate (200 basis points)
} as const
```

#### Conversion Functions
```typescript
const ETH_TO_USD = 4608.59

// USD → ETH for blockchain
const premiumETH = premiumUSD / ETH_TO_USD
const coverageETH = coverageUSD / ETH_TO_USD

// ETH → USD for display (if needed)
const displayUSD = valueETH * ETH_TO_USD
```
